**Credit Risk Analysis: Data Preprocessing Project**  
*Author: Manjiri Vadujkar*    

#### Overview  
This project is part of my Data Analyst portfolio and demonstrates my ability to preprocess real-world datasets for advanced analytics. Using a loan dataset, I focus on preparing data for Credit Risk Analysis by cleaning, transforming, and managing both textual and numerical data.  

#### Key Features  
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values using the CRM rule for numeric data and unique fillers for text data.  

2. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Converted text columns to numeric categories wherever possible.  
   - Mapped dates to numeric representations and converted USD values to EUR.  

3. **Optimization:**  
   - Renamed columns for better usability.  
   - Dropped redundant and irrelevant columns.  

4. **Automation:**  
   - Developed a checkpoint function to create backups of intermediate datasets.  

#### Repository Contents  
1. **Notebook:**  
   - `credit-risk-analysis-preprocessing.ipynb` – Main notebook containing the data preprocessing steps and detailed explanations.  

2. **Data Files:**  
   - `loan_data.csv` – Original dataset.  
   - `loan_data_preprocessed.csv` – Fully processed and cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
   - `EUR-USD.csv` - Currency Exchange Rates

3. **README.md:**  
   - Project overview and instructions.  

#### How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Credit-Risk-Analysis-Preprocessing.git
   ```    
2. Run the notebook `credit-risk-analysis-preprocessing.ipynb` to replicate the data preprocessing steps.  

#### Skills Demonstrated  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, redundancy, and inconsistencies.  
- **Data Transformation:** Numeric conversions, date processing, and currency conversion.  
- **Reproducibility:** Automated checkpointing for intermediate data backups.  
- **Documentation:** Clear and concise commentary for reproducibility and ease of understanding.
